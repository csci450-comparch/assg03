**Description**

Implement the following missing getter and accessor methods:

- class constructor
- `getNextProcessId()`
- `getNumActiveProcesses()`
- `readyQueueSize()`
- `blockedListSize()`


**Suggested Solution**


**Additional Requirements**

- You are required to correctly modify the `ProcessSimulator` class constructor to
  intialize the time slice quantum for a simulation as indicated, and initialize all
  other member variables to 0 or their initial value before the simulation starts.
