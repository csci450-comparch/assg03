/** @brief sign extend bits
 *
 * Given a 16-bit value and a sign position, perform a twos-complement sign
 * extension on the original 16-bit value.  For example, if the bits given are
 *    0000 0000 0001 1010
 * This number is a 5 bit value in twos-complement (-6 in this case), but we need
 * to extend this result to the full 16 bits before we can add this value to 
 * other twos-complement encoded values and get the expected result.  For a
 * sign_position of 5, the result after sign extend should be:
 *    1111 1111 1111 1010 (which is -6 in twos-complement encoded in full 16 bits)
 *
 * NOTE: This method assumes all bits in bit position+1 and higher have already been
 * masked to 0 before being called.
 *
 * @param bits The original bits that encode a twos-complement number but only int
 *    last n significant bits
 * @param sign_position The position of the sign bit that needs to be extended to
 *    all higher bits given bits value.
 *
 * @returns uint16_t Returns the bits with the sign bit extended to all higher

 * the register contains a twos-complement negative signed number (e.g. bit 15
 * is a 1), then the FN condition should be set for a negative number.  Otherwise
 * the FP condition flag should be set for a positive number.

/** @brief add operation
 *
 * Add two values together and store result in destination register.
 * In one version, when the FIMM flag at bit 5 is 0, there are two
 * source registers to add to get the result.  When the FIMM flag at
 * bit 5 is 1, then the least significant 5 bits are interpreted as an
 * immediate twos-complement signed value that is added to the source
 * register to get the result.  Don't forget that we need to perform
 * sign extension if we have an immediate value in the instruction.
 *
 * Although all values in registers are uint16_t (unsigned 16 bit
 * integers), we can cheat a bit and just use the C + operator to do
 * the addition.  This is because, adding the bits of twos-complement
 * encoded values gives the correct result.  The only issue is that
 * the result may no longer fit into 16-bit twos complement.  If it
 * overflows the results is nonsensical.  Some architectures have
 * additional condition codes that would detect and be set if this
 * type of overflow occurs.
 *
 * @param i The instruction.  The bits of the instruction we are
 *   executing.  We need all of the bits so that we can extract the

 * result.  When the FIMM flag at bit 5 is 1, then the least significant
 * 5 bits are extracted.  For consistency we interpret as a signed number,
